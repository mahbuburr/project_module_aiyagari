\section{Changes in idiosyncratic risk}

\begin{frame}{Questions}
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item {
	Does idiosyncratic risk matter? How do changes in such risk affect other economic variables? Are there distributional consequences?
	}
	
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How do we examine these questions?}
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item {
	We will look at changes in the unemployment benefit. 
	}
		
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{The model}
\begin{frame}{Model Summary}
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item {
	Ex ante identical individuals are subject to uninsurable idiosyncratic shocks. 
	}
	\item {
Agents can interact on the asset market.
	}
	\item {
The model generates an endogenous distribution of wealth across consumers. 
	}	
	\item {
Aggregates and prices are jointly determined by the saving behavior of the collection of all households. 
}

	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\subsection{Changes in the unemployment insurance}

\begin{frame}{Different levels of risk aversion}


  \centering{\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{parameters_sigma}}


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{First Observations}
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item {
	Changes in precautionary savings as a reaction to changes in idiosyncratic risk do affect aggregate variables.
	}

	\item {
	These magnitude of these changes varies for different levels of risk aversion.
	}
	
		\item {
	How do these aggregates compare to a situation with perfect insurance? 
	}

	\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}
	

\begin{frame}{Comparing to complete markets}
  \centering{\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{log-deviation}}

\end{frame}
	
		
\begin{frame}{Comparing to complete markets}
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item {
	As the insurance increases, the aggregates converge to the levels of the complete market economy. 
	}


	\end{itemize} 
\end{frame}
	
	
\begin{frame}{Distribution of capital}
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item {
These processes are driven by changes in precautionary savings reacting to changes in different levels of idiosyncratic risk. 
	}
	\item {
Let us look at the different distributions of capital. 
	}

	\end{itemize} 
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Distribution of capital}
  \centering{\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{distribution}}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Concluding on the distribution}

\begin{itemize} 


	\item {
As precautionary savings decrease, aggregate capital decreases, thus increasing the interest rate and reducing the wage. 
}
	\item {
The increase in unemployment benefits further reduces the net wage of the employed. The government has to increase income taxes to finance the higher unemployment benefits.
}
	\item {
Therefore, with higher unemployment benefits the agent's income depends more on his accumulated capital than his labor or benefits income. 
}
	\item {
The dispersion of the distribution therefore increases as benefits increase.
}


\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Concluding the first part}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item {
Idiosyncratic risk matters: 
Precautionary savings increase with higher uncertainty, thus increasing aggregate capital. 
	}	
	\item {
Increasing unemployment benefits has distributional consequences. 
	}	

	\end{itemize} 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The limitations}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item {
Idiosyncratic risk matters: 
Precautionary savings increase with higher uncertainty, thus increasing aggregate capital. 
	}	
	\item {
Increasing unemployment benefits has distributional consequences. 
	}	

	\end{itemize}

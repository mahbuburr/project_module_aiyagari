\begin{frame}{Welfare Measurement}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
  Which variable should we look at if we want to say consumers are better off? Output? Consumption?
  }
  \item {
  We want to measure somehow whether consumer welfare increased or not.
  }
  \item {
  But how to measure welfare? Can we compare the utility levels of consumers? And whose utility should we compare in a heterogeneous agent framework?
  }
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Life-time Utility}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
  We calculate the life-time utility of each agent when the economy is in steady state. One time before the policy change and once after the policy change.
  }
  \item {
  Cannot compare two steady states directly. We need to take the transition into account.
  }
  \item {
  Calculating the exact transition path is troublesome. We follow the approximation by Krussel, Mukoyama, and Sahin (2010) which takes care of the idiosyncratic transition.
  }
  \item {
  Just place the agents in the first economy with their current assets into the second economy.
  }
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Welfare Analysis}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
  Now we can compare the utility level of the same agent before and after the policy change.
  }
  \item {
  Need to come up with a way to quantify the utility differences sensibly.
  }
  \item {
  We calculate a consumption and a cash equivalent of the policy change.
  }
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Consumption Equivalent}
  \begin{itemize}

  \item {
  Permanent change of consumption by factor $\Delta$ that increases life-time
  utility by same amount as policy change:
  }
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{equation}
  U^{2}(e,k) = \mathbb{E}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\beta^{t}\frac{(c^{1}_{i,t}\Delta)^{1-\sigma}-1}{1-\sigma}\nonumber
  \end{equation}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
  If $ \Delta>1 $ agents prefer policy change $ (U^{2}) $, otherwise they do not want it.
  }
  \end{itemize}
